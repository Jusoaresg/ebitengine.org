<p>I am very happy to announce the release of v2.1.0 (<a href="/en/documents/2.1.html">Release Note</a>).</p>
<p>I appreciate all the contributors and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hajimehoshi">all the sponsors</a>. Thank you very much!</p>
<p>We focused performence tuning and stability on this release. The main new feature is supporting system cursors and new key constants.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I have nothing to announce about supporting Nintendo Switch so far. Please stay tuned!</p>
<p>I also released <a href="/en/documents/1.12.html#v1.12.12">v1.12.12</a> and <a href="/en/documents/2.0.html#v2.0.9">v2.0.9</a>. v1.12.12 is the last release of v1. If you are still using v1, I strongly recommend to <a href="/en/documents/to_v2.html">migrate to v2</a>.</p>
