<p>As we described in the <a href="/en/blog/roadmap2020.html">roadmap</a>, we will release Ebiten v2 this month. v2 includes incompatible changes with v2 in the API, but the others are almost same as v1. For migration from v1 to v2, please see <a href="/en/documents/to_v2.html">Ebiten v2 migration guide</a>. Basically we plan to add these quiet changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removing already-deprecated features (e.g., <code>Run</code>)</li>
  <li>Removing 'error' returning values from some functions (e.g., <code>DrawImage</code>)</li>
  <li>Adding new types to replace integers (e.g., <code>GamepadIDs</code>s will return <code>[]GamepadID</code> instead of <code>[]int</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ebiten v2.0.0-rc.1 has already been released, and you can try that now.</p>
<p>Ebiten v2.0.0 will come at earliest in a week. Stay tuned!</p>
