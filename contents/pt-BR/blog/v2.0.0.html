    <p>We are very happy to announce the release of v2.0.0 (<a href="/en/documents/2.0.html">Release Note</a>).</p>
    <p>I appreciate all the contributors and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hajimehoshi">all the sponsors</a>. Thank you very much!</p>
    <p>v2.0 doesn't have any new features. The features are same as v1.12. As there are breaking changes in the API, please refer <a href="/en/documents/to_v2.html">Ebiten 2.0 migration guide</a> for the details.</p>
    <p>The master branch has already been v2.1. Only bug fixes will be merged to v2.0 and v1.12. We plan to release v2.1.0 in March 2021. After releasing v2.1.0, v1.12 will no longer be maintained.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
