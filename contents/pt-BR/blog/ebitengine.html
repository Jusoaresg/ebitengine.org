<h1>We renamed Ebiten to Ebitengine</h1>
<p class="meta">Hajime Hoshi<br><span id="meta-created">2022-05-26</span></p>
<p>In order to make our engine more unique, we have decided to rename Ebiten to Ebitengine! Ebitengine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">a portmanteau</a> of an Ebiten and an Engine, and is pronounced like Ebi-Ten-Gin.</p>
<p>We don't change the website URL and the GitHub repository names. You never have to change your source code.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continuous support!</p>
