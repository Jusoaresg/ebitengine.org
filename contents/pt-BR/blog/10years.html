<p class="meta">Hajime Hoshi<br><span id="meta-created">2023-06-15</span></p>
<p>The first commit of Ebitengine was on June 15, 2013 (Japan Standard Time), and today marks the 10th anniversary. The reason we could come this far is thanks to everyone who has used Ebitengine, all the sponsors who supported us, and all the contributors who helped us. Thank you very much. We want to continue improving Ebitengine.</p>
<p>We are planning to kick off <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ebitengine-game-jam-2023">the Ebitengine Game Jam 2023</a> starting today. If you are interested, we warmly welcome your participation.</p>
