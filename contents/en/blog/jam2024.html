<h1>Ebitengine Game Jam 2024 Started</h1>
<p class="meta">Siôn le Roux, Hajime Hoshi<br><span id="meta-created">2024-06-15</span></p>
<p>The theme for the event is: <em>BUILDING</em> 🏗️🍤 (including build, build up, built, builder, etc.)!</p>
<p>For example, you could make a strategy game where you <em>build</em> a tower or a town, a puzzle where you need to <em>build</em> the right path or a tool to solve it, a story set in a very specific <em>building</em>, background music that is constantly <em>building up</em>... or any combination of these, or something completely different, these are just some starting ideas.  Feel free to interpret it figuratively or completely literally 😉 it's up to you, so get creative!</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to describe how your game uses the theme on your game page in case it's not immediately obvious.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted theme suggestions!</p>
